Whipper is a Python 2.7 CD-DA ripper based on the [morituri project](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri) (_CDDA ripper for *nix systems aiming for accuracy over speed_). It enhances morituri which development seems to have halted merging old ignored pull requests, improving it with bugfixes and new features.

Whipper is currently developed and tested _only_ on Linux distributions but _may_ work fine on other *nix OSes too.

In order to track whipper's latest changes it's advised to check its commit history (README and [CHANGELOG](#changelog) files may not be comprehensive).

## Rationale

For a detailed description, see morituri's wiki page: [The Art of the Rip](
https://web.archive.org/web/20160528213242/https://thomas.apestaart.org/thomas/trac/wiki/DAD/Rip).

## Features

- Detects correct read offset (in samples)
- Detects whether ripped media is a CD-R
- Has ability to defeat cache of drives
- Performs Test & Copy rips
- Verifies rip accuracy using the [AccurateRip database](http://www.accuraterip.com/)
- Uses [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/About) for metadata lookup
- Supports reading the [pre-emphasis](http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Pre-emphasis) flag embedded into some CDs (and correctly tags the resulting rip). _Currently whipper only reports the pre-emphasis flag value stored in the TOC._
- Detects and rips _non digitally silent_ [Hidden Track One Audio](http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=HTOA) (HTOA)
- Provides batch ripping capabilities
- Provides templates for file and directory naming
- Supports lossless encoding of ripped audio tracks (FLAC)
- Allows extensibility through external logger plugins

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

For detailed information, please check the commit history.

## Installation

Whipper still isn't available as an official package in every Linux distributions so, in order to use it, it may be necessary to [build it from its source code](#building).

## Building

If you are building from a source tarball or checkout, you can choose to use whipper installed or uninstalled _but first install all the required dependencies_.

### Required dependencies

Whipper relies on the following packages in order to run correctly and provide all the supported features:

- [cd-paranoia](https://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/), for the actual ripping
  - To avoid bugs it's advised to use `cd-paranoia` **10.2+0.94+2-2**
- [cdrdao](http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/), for session, TOC, pre-gap, and ISRC extraction
- [GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection), to provide GLib-2.0 methods used by `task.py`
- [PyGObject](https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/), required by `task.py`
- [python-musicbrainzngs](https://github.com/alastair/python-musicbrainzngs), for metadata lookup
- [python-mutagen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mutagen), for tagging support
- [python-setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools), for installation, plugins support
- [python-requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests), for retrieving AccurateRip database entries
- [pycdio](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycdio/), for drive identification (required for drive offset and caching behavior to be stored in the configuration file).
  - To avoid bugs  it's advised to use `pycdio` **0.20** or **0.21** with `libcdio` ≥ **0.90** ≤ **0.94**. If using `libcdio` **0.83**, which is _too old_ to satisfy all the requirements of whipper, just stick to `pycdio` **0.17**. Altough it needs additional testing, `libcdio` **2.0.0** seems to work fine if used with `pycdio` **2.0.0**. All other combinations aren't guaranteed to work.
- [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), for reading wav files
- [flac](https://xiph.org/flac/), for reading flac files
- [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/), for track peak detection

### Fetching the source code

Change to a directory where you want to put whipper source code (for example, `$HOME/dev/ext` or `$HOME/prefix/src`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper.git
cd whipper
```

### Building the bundled dependencies

Whipper uses and packages a slightly different version of the `accuraterip-checksum` tool:

You can edit the install path in `config.mk`

```bash
cd src
make
sudo make install
cd ..
```

### Finalizing the build

Install whipper: `python2 setup.py install`

Note that, depending on the chosen installation path, this command may require elevated rights.

## Usage

Whipper currently only has a command-line interface called `whipper` which is self-documenting: `whipper -h` gives you the basic instructions.

Whipper implements a tree of commands: for example, the top-level `whipper` command has a number of sub-commands.

Positioning of arguments is important:

`whipper cd -d (device) rip`

is correct, while

`whipper cd rip -d (device)`

is not, because the `-d` argument applies to the `cd` command.

## Getting started

The simplest way to get started making accurate rips is:

1. Pick a relatively popular CD that has a good chance of being in the AccurateRip database
2. Analyze the drive's caching behavior

   `whipper drive analyze`

3. Find the drive's offset.

   Consult the [AccurateRip's CD Drive Offset database](http://www.accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm) for your drive. Drive information can be retrieved with `whipper drive list`.

   `whipper offset find -o insert-numeric-value-here`

   If you omit the `-o` argument, whipper will try a long, popularity-sorted list of drive offsets.

   If you can not confirm your drive offset value but wish to set a default regardless, set `read_offset = insert-numeric-value-here` in `whipper.conf`.

   Offsets confirmed with `whipper offset find` are automatically written to the configuration file.

   If specifying the offset manually, please note that: if positive it must be written as a number without sign (ex: `+102` -> `102`), if negative it must include the sign too (ex: `-102` -> `-102`).

4. Rip the disc by running

   `whipper cd rip`

## New options

The option `--verbose-toc` has been added to `whipper cd rip`. It slightly increases the ripping time but shows CRC errors and provides more detail when ripping the disc. The added information is not added to the log file to remain compliant with the original version of whipper.

## Configuration file documentation

The configuration file is stored in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/whipper/whipper.conf`, or `$HOME/.config/whipper/whipper.conf` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is undefined.

See [XDG Base Directory
Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
and [ConfigParser](https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html).

The configuration file consists of newline-delineated `[sections]`
containing `key = value` pairs. The sections `[main]` and
`[musicbrainz]` are special config sections for options not accessible
from the command line interface.  Sections beginning with `drive` are
written by whipper; certain values should not be edited.

Example configuration demonstrating all `[main]` and `[musicbrainz]`
options:

```INI
[main]
path_filter_fat = True		; replace FAT file system unsafe characters in filenames with _
path_filter_special = False	; replace special characters in filenames with _

[musicbrainz]
server = musicbrainz.org:80	; use MusicBrainz server at host[:port]

[drive:HL-20]
defeats_cache = True		; whether the drive is capable of defeating the audio cache
read_offset = 6			; drive read offset in positive/negative frames (no leading +)
# do not edit the values 'vendor', 'model', and 'release'; they are used by whipper to match the drive

# command line defaults for `whipper cd rip`
[whipper.cd.rip]
unknown = True
output_directory = ~/My Music
track_template = new/%%A/%%y - %%d/%%t - %%n	; note: the format char '%' must be represented '%%'
disc_template = %(track_template)s
# ...
```

## `ripcd` script
There's a script called `whatcd` in this source distribution. copy it to /usr/local/bin and edit it to change `$DESTDIR` to where you want the rips saved.

## Running uninstalled

To make it easier for developers, you can run whipper straight from the
source checkout:

```bash
python2 -m whipper -h
```

## Logger plugins

Whipper supports using external logger plugins to write rip `.log` files.

List available plugins with `whipper cd rip -h`. Specify a logger to rip with by passing `-L loggername`:

```bash
whipper cd rip -L what
```

### Official logger plugins

Unfortunately both logger plugins are currently outdated and won't work with latest whipper versions.

- [morituri-eaclogger](https://github.com/JoeLametta/morituri-eaclogger) - eac-like logger attempting to maintain strict compatiility with EAC
- [morituri-whatlogger](https://github.com/RecursiveForest/morituri-whatlogger) - eac-like logger containing the informational enhancements of the yamllogger, originally designed for use on What.CD
